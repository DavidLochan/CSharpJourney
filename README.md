# C# Learning Journey

This repository documents my learning journey with C# and .NET.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Build strong fundamentals in C#
- Practice hands-on coding regularly
- Track progress through small exercises and mini-projects

I will be updating this repository continuously as I learn and improve.
